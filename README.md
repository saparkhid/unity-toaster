# unity-toaster
In an android game/application a toast provides simple feedback about an operation in a small popup. It only fills the amount of space required for the message and the current activity remains visible and interactive. Toasts automatically disappear after a timeout.
By this plugin you can bring android's toast feature into your unity3D android app/game.
